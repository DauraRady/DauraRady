## 🌟 About Me

Hi! I'm **Daura**, a former financial analyst who made a bold move into **QA Engineering**.  
I specialize in **functional and automated testing** with tools like **Playwright**, **Postman**, and **Python**.

My background in data analysis, validation, and project delivery helps me bring a sharp, business-oriented perspective to testing. I'm passionate about building solid, tested, and user-friendly applications.
